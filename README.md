## Loan Default Prediction
Assessing the credit risk of a borrower is paramount to the success of financial institutions. It gives lenders the ability to minimize potential loss that may occur as a result of loan defaults. Too many losses within a financial institution can create a snowball effect that will eventually result in high negative profit, or net loss, leading the financial institution to go out of business, decreasing the availability of credit and damaging trust in the financial system. In the worst case scenario, the accumulation of bad loans by many banks at once can lead to an economic recession, such as the 2008 recession, caused by banks accumulating subprime mortgages —housing loans given to borrowers with poor credit histories. The process of assessing credit risk also optimizes the amount of revenue gained through interest accumulated on loans made out to borrowers. By effectively predicting borrower behavior, lenders can make informed decisions, reduce the amount of bad debt that they hold, and ensure long-term financial stability.
Our objective is to utilize machine learning to identify patterns and factors that influence credit risk. The dataset that we will be using comes from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). It contains historical information on borrowers; including features such as credit score, income, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio, and loan purpose. The feature, “default”, indicates whether a borrower defaulted on their loan. This will be our target feature. 
Using this dataset, we aim to build a powerful machine learning model that accurately predicts the likelihood of loan defaults. By understanding the hidden relationships between the demographic of borrowers and default risks, our model will help financial institutions allocate their lending resources more efficiently, which in turn, will minimize losses and maximize profits through more precise risk assessments.
